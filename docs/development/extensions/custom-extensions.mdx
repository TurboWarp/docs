# Custom Extensions for Developers

TurboWarp supports custom extensions specified via URL parameter.

:::note
Our documentation about custom extensions in general leaves a lot to be desired, especially for [unsandboxed extensions](unsandboxed-extensions). We know. We're working on it.
:::

The easiest way to load a custom extension is to open the add extension library then select "Custom Extension". You can also use the `?extension=` URL parameter.

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import useDocusaurusContext from '@docusaurus/useDocusaurusContext';

export const ExampleExtensionLink = ({name}) => {
  const {siteConfig} = useDocusaurusContext();
  const base = typeof location !== 'undefined' ? location.origin : siteConfig.url;
  const url = `https://turbowarp.org/editor?extension=${base}/example-extensions/${name}`;
  return <p>
    <a href={url}>Test this example here.</a> (Do not use this link to make real projects!)
  </p>;
};

:::warning
Projects that use custom extensions cannot be uploaded to the Scratch website. The project can only be loaded by a TurboWarp instance with the same extensions already loaded from the URL.

## Introduction to writing custom extensions {#introduction}

:::info
This page assumes you are already familiar with JavaScript. If you don't already understand JavaScript, reading this page will not be an enjoyable experience.

This page is still a work in progress. You're welcome and encouraged to suggest or even write improvements on GitHub.

:::warning
The example extension URLs found in this document should NOT be used in real projects. There is no guarantee they will continue to work in the future.

Custom extensions run in a [sandbox](#sandbox) and have limited access to scratch internals. This is very limiting, but custom extensions can still access powerful APIs such as `fetch`, `WebSocket`, and other web APIs.

Due to technical limitations of the sandbox, every call to a custom extension will stop the current script for a full frame, regardless of turbo mode or run without screen refresh.

Custom extensions need to be loaded from a website, for example GitHub Pages. For development, you may find it best to set up a local HTTP server. If you happen to have Python installed, that can be as easy as `python -m http.server`.

## Hello, world! {#hello-world}

The simplest custom extension looks something like this:

<CodeBlock className="language-js" title="example.js">
  {require("!!raw-loader!@site/static/example-extensions/hello-world.js").default}
</CodeBlock>
<ExampleExtensionLink name="example.js" />

Save this in a file on your computer and use a local HTTP server to load it using the extension parameter. If you have a local HTTP server started with `python -m http.server`, you might visit https://turbowarp.org/editor?extension=http://localhost:8000/example.js. The extension will add a new category that contains a single reporter block that outputs "Hello, world!"

## getInfo {#getInfo}

`getInfo` is a function that tells Scratch about your extension and what blocks it supports.

 - `id` is a string that represents a unique ID that this extension uses. It should only contain the characters a-z and 0-9. The same extension should always use the same ID as changing it will break existing projects.
 - `name` is a string that tells Scratch what name to display in the sidebar
 - `blocks` is a list of objects that defines which blocks your extension contains.
   - `opcode` is the internal name of the block, and also corresponds to the method that will be called when the block is run. Opcodes should never be changed.
   - `blockType` defines the type of block
     - `Scratch.BlockType.REPORTER` makes a round reporter
     - `Scratch.BlockType.BOOLEAN` makes a triangle shaped reporter that can fit into boolean inputs
     - `Scratch.BlockType.COMMAND` makes a stacked block
   - `text` is a string that defines what the block will be named in the editor. Text in \[brackets\] will be converted to slots for arguments (see below examples)
   - `arguments` is an object that defines the arguments that the block accepts. Each argument has:
     - `type` which defines the input shape to make. Note that regardless of the type set here, the values actually passed to the block are not guaranteed to be casted to the right type. You should manually convert arguments to numbers, for example, as they will often be passed as strings.
       - `Scratch.ArgumentType.STRING` for string inputs
       - `Scratch.ArgumentType.NUMBER` for number inputs
       - `Scratch.ArgumentType.BOOLEAN` for boolean inputs (defaultValue is ignored)
       - `Scratch.ArgumentType.ANGLE` for angles
       - `Scratch.ArgumentType.COLOR` for colors (#123abc string format)
       - `Scratch.ArgumentType.MATRIX` for a 5x5 matrix (passed in 11101010101... string format)
       - `Scratch.ArgumentType.NOTE` for music notes
     - `defaultValue` is the initial value when the block is created from the library
   - `disableMonitor` can be set to `true` to force remove the checkbox by a block to create a monitor

### Backwards Compatibility {#backwards-compatibility}

Extensions should strive to be as backwards compatible as possible. Notably, that means:

 - NEVER change the extension ID
 - NEVER remove blocks
 - NEVER change opcodes
 - NEVER significantly change behavior of blocks
   - That doesn't mean you can't change it slightly or fix bugs, but any valid call to your blocks should always do the same thing, in perpetuity
 - Extensively test your extension on existing projects

Failing to follow these guidelines may effectively corrupt projects.
