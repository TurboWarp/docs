# Sharing your extension

If you want to share your extension with the broader world, you'll have to find a place to put it.

Note that, if you only care about using your own extensions in your own projects and will use the packager to share your project with others, you don't need to submit your extension anywhere as the packager always runs extensions without the sandbox.

## Sandboxed extensions

Sandboxed extensions can be hosted anywhere that offers static file hosting and HTTPS.

A common choice is [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Note that GitHub's "raw" links (raw.githubusercontent.com) do not work; you must use GitHub Pages instead.

## Unsandboxed extensions

The best way to share your unsandboxed extension is to submit it to extensions.turbowarp.org: https://github.com/TurboWarp/extensions/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
