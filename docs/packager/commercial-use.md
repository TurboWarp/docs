# Can I sell projects made with the TurboWarp Packager?

Yes, if you have the rights to all the costumes, sounds, scripts, and extensions inside the project you package, it is possible to sell it.

The TurboWarp Packager is provided under [a free and open source license](https://github.com/TurboWarp/packager/blob/master/LICENSE). You can use files generated by the packager in any way **with no license fee and no royalty**. In place of a license fee, we ask you to donate to and volunteer at charity organizations in your local community. They need your support far more than I do. Make your community a better place.

If you used costumes, sounds, scripts, or extensions created by other people, make sure you have permission from those people to sell their work. If you found something on the Scratch website, you should probably ask the creator for permission before using it. The license for content found on Scratch is currently quite ambiguous. If you want to use a Scratch trademark, you should probably ask the Scratch Foundation about that too.
