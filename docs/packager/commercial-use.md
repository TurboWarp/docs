# Can I sell projects made with the TurboWarp Packager?

:::note

Yes, if you have the rights to all the costumes, sounds, scripts, and extensions inside the project you package, it is possible to sell it.

The TurboWarp Packager is provided under [a free and open source license](https://github.com/TurboWarp/packager/blob/master/LICENSE). You can use files generated by the packager in any way **with no license fee and no royalty**. In place of a license fee, we encourage you to [donate to the Scratch Foundation](https://www.scratchfoundation.org/donate).

:::

If you used costumes, sounds, scripts, or extensions created by other people, make sure you have permission from those people to sell their work. Most things you find on the Scratch website are supposed to be available under the [CC BY-SA 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/) license which technically doesn't prevent you from re-selling the work, but it requires attribution and the share-alike clause may have significant implications. Creators can grant you additional permissions on top of the CC BY-SA 2.0 if they choose.

Note that the Scratch trademarks such as the Scratch Logo, Scratch cat, Gobo, Pico, etc. are an exception to the CC BY-SA 2.0 license, and you might not have permission to use them.

For more information, see "May I use / remix Scratch support materials, sprites, images, sounds or sample projects Iâ€™ve found on the website?" and "Can I sell my Scratch projects?" in https://scratch.mit.edu/faq
