:::info
Use the TurboWarp Packager here: https://packager.turbowarp.org/

The TurboWarp Packager converts Scratch projects into HTML files, zip archives, or executable programs for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It's like HTMLifier and the forkphorus packager.

This is the place where some extra documentation goes. Use the sidebar on the left to navigate.
