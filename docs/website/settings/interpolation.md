# Interpolation

Interpolation makes motion animations in projects appear smoother by interpolating movement of sprites between frames. It's basically a higher framerate without affecting how fast scripts run. It is really affective on projects like Appel and Getting Over It. :)

Interpolation should not be used on:

 - 3D projects
 - Raytracers
 - Pen projects
 - Laggy projects

Interpolation is unlikely to make these projects look smoother because interpolation can't interpolate pen, but it will hurt performance.

Interpolation can introduce slight (up to 1/30th of a second) input latency.

You may see some graphical glitches on complex projects such as scrolling platformers.
