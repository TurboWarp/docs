# Disable Compiler

This option turns off the TurboWarp compiler, which lets script update immediately, as in Scratch. This is only useful when debugging bugs in the compiler or when using the editor to create a project.

:::warning
Never change this unless you really know what you're doing.
:::

You can enable the "Disable compiler in editor" addon to turn the compiler off by default in the editor.
