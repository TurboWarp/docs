# Remove Miscellaneous Limits

Disables various limits that aren't significant enough to get a dedicated toggle.

 - Pitch sound effect range is increased from 360 to 1000
 - Blocks that set or change sound effects or volume run instantly instead of stopping the script for a full frame
 - Minimum pen size is reduced from 1 to 0 and maximum pen is increased from 1200 to infinite
 - Mouse X and Y coordinates will not be rounded, which can be useful in fullscreen

This list will be expanded over time.
