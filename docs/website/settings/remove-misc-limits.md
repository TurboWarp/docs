# Remove Miscellaneous Limits

Controls various limits that aren't significant enough to get their own dedicated toggle.

 - Pitch and pan left/right sound effect limit is removed
 - Blocks that set or change sound effect or volume levels run instantly instead of stopping the script for a full frame
 - Minimum pen size is reduced to 0 (normally 1) and maximum pen size (normally 1200) is removed

This list may be expanded over time.
