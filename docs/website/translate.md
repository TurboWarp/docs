# Help Translate TurboWarp

We're looking for people to help translate TurboWarp into languages other than English. If that interests you, read on.

## Requirements to join as a translator {#requirements}

 - You must be **FLUENT IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE**.
 - For example, you’re fluent if you can use TurboWarp in English, or if you understand griffpatch’s videos. If you struggle to understand sentences without a translator, you’re not fluent.
 - You must be a **NATIVE SPEAKER** of the language you want to translate to.
 - You must have an email address, which you should ideally check at least once a week.
 - You must own an account on [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu/).

If you’re not a native speaker but consider yourself fluent enough, you may also request to join. Keep in mind taking some language classes does not make you fluent. If you wouldn’t change your smartphone’s system language to it, you’re not fluent enough!

We only support languages that Scratch itself supports. Support for RTL languages such as Arabic and Hebrew is currently a work-in-progress. They should mostly work in the editor, but places like the desktop app and packager require additional changes. Efforts to improve this will be prioritized when some more translations are written.

## Steps to join as a translator {#request-to-join}

### 1. Verify your Scratch account

1. Visit [this Scratch studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/33665222/comments) with your Scratch account.
2. Send a studio comment indicating the language you want to translate to (for example, `Greek`).
