# Help Translate TurboWarp

We're looking for people to help translate TurboWarp into languages other than English. If that interests you, read on.

Create a new discussion if you have questions following this guide: https://github.com/TurboWarp/scratch-gui/discussions

## Joining the translation team

### Requirements

 - You are expected to read this entire document.
 - You must be fluent in both English and another language.
 - We want translations written by humans, not by machines. That means **NO Google Translate** or other machine translators.
 - Requests to translate new languages that aren't already supported by Scratch will be rejected.
 - The initial translation for new languages should take under an hour. Please check occasionally to translate any newly added strings. This isn't expected to be a large time commitment. Don't lose sleep over this. We're all unpaid volunteers.

### Request to join
 
 - Go to [our Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/turbowarp/turbowarp/), and click on the blue "Help Translate TurboWarp" button.
 - You'll probably have to create a Transifex account. Try to use the same username as your Scratch account so that we can add you to the [credits page](https://turbowarp.org/credits.html). Enter your email, a new password, then Sign Up.
 - When asked for your name, enter your username as your name and surname instead of your real name. For "department" and "job title", select "localization" and "individual contributor".
 - On then next step, select "join an existing project".
 - Choose the language(s) you want to translate into.

The request will be accepted within a few days.

If the request is rejected, that most likely means that Scratch (and by extension, TurboWarp) does not support that language or that we already have enough translators for that language.

## Writing translations

Find your language on https://www.transifex.com/turbowarp/turbowarp/dashboard/ and click the Translate button.

Read https://docs.transifex.com/translation/translating-with-the-web-editor to learn how to use the Transifex translator.

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and put into the website.

The most important resource to translate is `gui.json`. You should start with this one.
