# Help Translate TurboWarp

We're looking for people to help translate TurboWarp into languages other than English. If that interests you, read on.

## Requests to join are on hold and will be ignored {#on-hold}

Due to persistent and pervasive translation quality issues, requests to join the translation team sent through Transifex **WILL BE IGNORED**. We apologize for the inconvenience.

## Requirements {#requirements}

**We would rather have no translations than bad translations.**

 - You MUST be **at least 18 years old**. We know this is a significant barrier, but if you are less than 18 years old, your language skills are not sufficient for us to trust you with translating our project, and creating a Transifex account would violate the Transifex Terms of Service.
 - You MUST be fluent in both English and another language. Taking a couple years of a language class in school DOES NOT make you fluent.
 - You MUST write translations yourself. **NO Google Translate or other machine translators**.

If you do not meet these requirements, please DO NOT request to join our Transifex. It will do a favor for both of us.

Joining the translation team DOES NOT confer you any extra benefits, clout, or get your name listed on the credits page. ONLY join if you want to help translate and are *actually* fluent.

## Request to join {#request-to-join}
 
 - Go to [our Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/turbowarp/turbowarp/), and click on the purple "Join this project" button.
 - You'll probably have to create a Transifex account. Enter your email, a new password, then Sign Up.
 - When asked for your name, enter your username as your name and surname instead of your real name. For "department" and "job title", select "localization" and "individual contributor".
 - On then next step, select "join an existing project".
 - Choose the language(s) you want to translate into.

The request will be accepted within a few days.

If the request is rejected, that most likely means that Scratch (and by extension, TurboWarp) does not support that language.

## Writing translations {#writing-translations}

Find your language on https://www.transifex.com/turbowarp/turbowarp/dashboard/ and click the Translate button.

Read https://docs.transifex.com/translation/translating-with-the-web-editor to learn how to use the Transifex translator.

Translations are pulled from Transifex periodically.

Our translations are broken up into a different resource for each subproject:

 - `gui.json` is for the [website and editor](https://turbowarp.org). This is the most important file to translate.
 - `desktop.json` is for [the desktop app](https://desktop.turbowarp.org/).
 - `desktop-web.json` is for [the desktop app's website](https://desktop.turbowarp.org/).
 - `addons.json` is for the [addon settings page](https://turbowarp.org/addons) (not the addons themselves).
 - Translations for the addons themselves are maintained externally. Due to Scratch's policy on browser extensions, we will not link that page here, sorry.
 - `packager.json` is for [the packager](https://packager.turbowarp.org/).
 - `store-listings.yaml` is for the desktop app's listings in places like the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/9P4DPZGV5ZKL)
