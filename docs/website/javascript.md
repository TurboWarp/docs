# How to download the JavaScript

## Short Answer {#short}

 * If you want to package/HTMLify a project, use https://packager.turbowarp.org/
 * If you want to convert Scratch projects to readable and editable JavaScript, use https://leopardjs.com/ instead of TurboWarp

## Long Answer {#long}

The code generated by TurboWarp is not designed to be read or edited by humans. Attempting to do so would be actively harmful to one's learning because of the many unusual things done to improve compatibility or performance.

For example, in regular JavaScript accessing a list item is as simple as `myList[myIndex]`, but TurboWarp could do anything from `(b1.value[(b0.value | 0) - 1] ?? "")` to `listGet(b0, b1.value)` depending on the context around the list block. `b0` and `b1` are real variable names that TurboWarp will use and `listGet` is a part of the TurboWarp runtime, not part of the JavaScript standard. The code also lacks any formatting. Some more code samples are available in [another page](how).

<summary>If you really know what you're doing...</summary>

Run this in the JavaScript console before starting the project:

```js
vm.enableDebug();
```

Then the JavaScript will be logged to the console when it gets compiled.

If you don't know what a "JavaScript console" is or how to access it, then it's in your best interest to not look at the generated JavaScript anyways.
