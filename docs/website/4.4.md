# Regarding Scratch Terms of Use Section 4.4

Some people have noticed that Scratch's [Terms of Use](https://scratch.mit.edu/terms_of_use) includes these texts:

> 4.4 You may only submit user-generated projects that were created with (1) the Scratch website editor or (2) an unmodified copy of the Scratch editor compiled from the source code described in Section 5.3. You may not upload any projects that were created, by you or by anyone else, with a modified version of the Scratch editor.

> 5.3 The source code for Scratch 1.4 is available for download and subject to the copyright notice as indicated on the [Scratch FAQ](https://scratch.mit.edu/faq) page.

We can't speak on behalf of the Scratch Team, but we will say a couple things regarding this:

 - We are not aware of any instance of this being enforced (please [let us know](https://github.com/TurboWarp/docs/issues) if this is wrong).
 - If enforced exactly as written, uploading any projects made in the Scratch 2 or Scratch 3 offline editors is technically a violation.
 - Don't do things that would upset the Scratch Team like requiring people to use TurboWarp to run the project. It's probably okay to suggest it, but you must let that suggestion be ignored.
 - It is not uncommon for websites to have lines in their policies that aren't actively enforced to protect themselves in exceptional circumstances.
 - TurboWarp is definitely a "modified version of the Scratch editor"
