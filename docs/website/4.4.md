# Regarding Scratch Terms of Use Section 4.4

Some people have noticed that Scratch's [Terms of Use](https://scratch.mit.edu/terms_of_use) includes these texts:

> 4.4 You may only submit user-generated projects that were created with (1) the Scratch website editor or (2) an unmodified copy of the Scratch editor compiled from the source code described in Section 5.3. You may not upload any projects that were created, by you or by anyone else, with a modified version of the Scratch editor.

<!-- > 5.3 The source code for Scratch 1.4 is available for download and subject to the copyright notice as indicated on the [Scratch FAQ](https://scratch.mit.edu/faq) page. -->

**We can't speak on behalf of the Scratch Team**, but we will say a few things:

 - TurboWarp is definitely a "modified version of the Scratch editor".
 - We are not aware of any instance of this being enforced (please [let us know](https://github.com/TurboWarp/docs/issues) if this is wrong).
 - Don't do things that would upset the Scratch Team like forcing people to use TurboWarp to run the project. It's probably okay to suggest it, but you must let that suggestion be easily ignored.
 - It is common for websites to have policies that aren't actively enforced to protect themselves in exceptional circumstances.
