# Cloud Variables

TurboWarp has its own cloud variable server independent of Scratch.

Some things to keep in mind:

 - Anyone can change their username using the "Edit > Change Username" menu. A user who appears to be named "griffpatch" is most likely not the real griffpatch.
 - To reduce abuse, the cloud variable server rejects any username that doesn't belong to an existing Scratch account.
 - Names of Scratch Team members cannot be used due to potential abuse. That includes ScratchCat.
 - The variable length limit has been significantly increased (it allows tens of thousands of characters)
 - Cloud variables can still only hold numbers.
 - Cloud variables are reset very often, so don't rely on them to store things like leaderboards.
 - Cloud variables are disabled when the editor is opened.
 - Do not abuse cloud variables to make unmoderated chat rooms.
