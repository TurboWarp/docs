# Donatations

TurboWarp will not be accepting donations after July 22, 2025. Until then, you can donate at the places below.

 * https://github.com/sponsors/GarboMuffin
 * https://muffin.ink/donate

A slightly longer explanation was shared with current recurring donors, but the summary is:

 * I have not been working on the project enough to justify accepting donations.
 * I started a new job with a strict employment agreement, but it pays well enough that donations are no longer needed.
 * I want to work on other things that aren't related to Scratch.

But to be clear: TurboWarp is not going anywhere. Just not accepting donations.

The Scratch Foundation does much more important work than I do, and they need your money more than I do. https://www.scratchfoundation.org/donate
