# TurboWarp Docs

https://docs.turbowarp.org/

This repository contains documentation for TurboWarp.

## Writing content

If you found a typo or have a suggestion to improve the pages, the easiest way to get it resolved is to post about it on the Scratch profile https://scratch.mit.edu/users/GarboMuffin/#comments or in GitHub issues https://github.com/TurboWarp/docs/issues/new. Alternatively, you can submit a pull request yourself containing a fix.

If you'd like to write a new page, we'd prefer that you ask us first before you spend much time writing.

## Local Development

This website is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Documentation is inside the `docs` folder, generally that is all you will have to touch. We accept pull requests.
